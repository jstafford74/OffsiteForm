# M.E.R.N Stack Seed Project with JWT Auth

M.E.R.N: Mongo, Express, React, Node Stack

This is a single page application (SPA) GUI and Node Express API server.

The server and GUI are coded to authenticate users with username and password.

Authentication info is stored in a JSON Web Token.  The server is session free.

The app currently supports:
* New User sign up with a username and password
* Login
* Logout
* Auto log out if refresh token is expired when request to protected URL is made
* Auto creation of new auth token if refresh token is still valid (so if a user is using the app they will not be logged out if they have not made a protected api call within `ACCESS_TOKEN_DURATION`)

Missing from app:
* Auto logout due to inactivity
* Profile page with Change password screen
* Profile page with Change username screen
* Profile Picture/avatar upload
* Delete account page


App can be run locally by:

1. renaming file `.env_sample` to `.env`
2. From project root directory, run:
   1. `npm i`
   2. `npm run seed` (to seed the mongo DB - make sure mongo is running)
   3.  `npm start`


or can be used on heroku at:
